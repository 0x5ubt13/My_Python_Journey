# Subtle Discord bot

In an attempt to put my python skills to a test and learning further, instead of inviting an already made Discord bot to my CTF server, I decided to create my very own bot from scratch.

The main functionality I'm looking for to implement is for people to be able to assign roles themselves when reacting to certain emojis.

If you want to check it out, go ahead and look at the code and make your own bot yourself!
